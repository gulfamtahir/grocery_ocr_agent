# Introduction
Grocery OCR Agent is an AI-driven tool designed to help users effortlessly manage their grocery expenses.

By simply uploading a photo or scanned image of a grocery receipt, the agent uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract item details, prices, and totals â€” automatically keeping track of purchases.

This project aims to simplify expense tracking, budgeting, and inventory management with minimal user effort.
